# Cancer-Variant-Analyser
A cancer variant Analyser is a graph data lineage that shows the mutations that have happened within normal genes and which peptide position


The problem
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 (1). The most common in 2020 (in terms of new cases of cancer) were:

breast (2.26 million cases);
lung (2.21 million cases);
colon and rectum (1.93 million cases);
prostate (1.41 million cases);
skin (non-melanoma) (1.20 million cases); and
stomach (1.09 million cases).

The solution

This is a comprehensive  Tigergraph database for annotating driver and passenger mutations in terms of Cancer.

The application allows us to view the relationship between gene mutation and cancer.

The main graph is do that graph

The solution file can be easily imported I have completely exported the solution from graph studio as a tar.gz file.

The other notebook is creating another graph between cancer type and variant using api calls from
